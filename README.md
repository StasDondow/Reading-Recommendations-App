# Reading-Recommendations-App

In the **Reading_Recommendations.ipynb** file the search system for contextually close texts is considered.

To find similar texts the "bag of words" model is used and the corresponding Euclidean distances for the texts are compared.

The dataset of books is collected manually from open sources.
